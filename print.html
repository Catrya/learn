<p><strong>Lnp2pBot</strong> is a bitcoin exchange system for local currency, enabling easy and secure person-to-person transactions using Lightning Network. It is a Telegram bot that can be used pseudonymously, without user registration or identity verification. This tool only holds satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin) for the minimum necessary time, providing greater security to users compared to exchange services with internal wallets and complete custody of funds. <strong>Lnp2pBot</strong> is an open-source application, allowing for auditing, replication, modification, and redistribution with freedom.

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XCSfoiD8wUA">Lighting Network</a> is a network of payment channels that works as a second layer protocol on the Bitcoin network, taking advantage of the property of writing smart contracts on its blockchain. It is a scalability solution that allows exponentially increasing the number of transactions and their speed by not needing on-chain confirmations, while drastically reducing network fees. Payments become instant and cost almost nothing.</p>

<p>You only need an account on <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> with an active <em>"username"</em> or <a href="https://telegram.org/faq?setln=en#usernames-and-t-me">username</a> to initialize the bot and interact with it. Additionally, you'll require a wallet that supports the Lightning Network. <a href="./recommended-wallets.html">Here are some recommended wallets</a>.</p>

<p>To create your <code>Buy / Sell</code> orders for Bitcoin, use the chat with <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a>.</p>
<p>The offers created with <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pBot</a> are published in Telegram channels from where they can be taken by clicking the <code>Buy Satoshis</code> or <code>Sell Satoshis</code> button that appears below each one.</p>
<p>There is a general channel <a href="https://t.me/p2plightning">@p2plightning</a> where offers that do not belong to any <a href="./communities.html">community</a> are listed, hence there are various fiat currencies available. Additionally, there are <a href="./community-find.html">channels associated with communities</a> where only offers with the fiat currencies permitted in those communities are published.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="where-can-i-find-offers-in-my-local-currency"><a class="header" href="#where-can-i-find-offers-in-my-local-currency">Where can I find offers in my local currency?</a></h1>
<p>You can ask the bot by running the command <code>/findcomms</code> along with the <a href="./in-which-countries-is-it-available.html">code for your currency</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, to see the <a href="./communities.html">communities</a> in Venezuelan bolivars, you should type:</p>
<p><code>/findcomms ves</code></p>
<p>You can also search for offers filtered by currencies and communities on <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a> and in the general channel <a href="https://t.me/p2plightning">@p2plightning</a>.</p>

<p>NO! Bitcoin was born as <em>"a peer-to-peer electronic money system"</em>, and we are proud to support that principle. No personal information is required from you, the exchanges are entirely between peers, and <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pBot</a> does not collect or store any personal information of the parties involved.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-type-of-information-do-you-collect-from-each-user"><a class="header" href="#what-type-of-information-do-you-collect-from-each-user">What type of information do you collect from each user?</a></h1>
<p>For the purposes of the user reputation system, lnp2pBot collects some statistics on your trades. Specifically, the number of completed transactions, the total volume traded, the counterparty rating and the record of disputes if any. Of this information, only the number of transactions and the counterparty rating are public by default. Meanwhile, showing the total volume traded and your username is optional (you choose to show it or not, by default it is not shown).</p>
<p>In case you want to show your username and/or volume traded to accompany your reputation in the offers you publish, you must do it manually through the following commands:</p>
<p><code>/showusername</code> yes</p>
<p><code>/showvolume</code> yes</p>
<p>Each command is sent as a direct message to the bot.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-does-the-user-reputation-system-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-the-user-reputation-system-work">How does the user reputation system work?</a></h1>
<p>For every transaction you conduct, you'll be asked to rate your counterpart, and they'll rate you in return. <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot"><strong>lnp2pBot</strong></a> uses a 5-star rating system that allows you to evaluate your experience, where 1 star is the lowest rating and 5 stars are the highest.</p>
<p>To determine reputation, the bot conducts an iterative calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the ratings and successful operations. Hence, in the initial transactions, even if you've been rated with the maximum, your reputation won't be high initially. It gradually increases as you conduct more operations with good ratings.</p>
<p>You can see this calculation at: <a href="https://github.com/lnp2pBot/bot/blob/main/bot/commands.js#L279">https://github.com/lnp2pBot/bot/blob/main/bot/commands.js#L279</a></p>
<p>It's based on:
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2148877/iterative-calculation-of-mean-and-standard-deviation">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2148877/iterative-calculation-of-mean-and-standard-deviation</a></p>
<p>When you create an offer, it will include by default the number of successful operations you've conducted, the ratings received from your counterparts, and the number of operations performed. We recommend considering all these aspects when accepting an offer to avoid scams.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-create-a-sell-order"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-create-a-sell-order">How do I create a sell order?</a></h1>
<p>When chatting with <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pBot</a> you will find a "Menu" button. Click it to display the list of commands you can use. Select the sell command: <code>/sell</code>, to activate the wizard that will guide you through the selling process.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/sell-start.jpg" alt="Start the wizard" /></p>
<p>Once activated, the wizard will ask you to specify the fiat currency in which you want to trade:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/sell-fiat.jpg" alt="Fiat currency" /></p>
<p>Next, you must enter the amount, in fiat currency, that you want in exchange for your satoshis. Remember to enter only numbers in this step, so that the wizard can understand you.</p>
<p>You can also enter a range of amounts to buy, separating the numbers by a hyphen (-).</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/amount.jpg" alt="Fiat Amount" /></p>
<p>The bot will ask you the amount, in satoshis, you want to deliver. Here you have the possibility to use the "Market price" button. If you do so, the rate of <a href="https://yadio.io/">Yadio. io</a> will be applied.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/amount-sats-market-price.jpg" alt="Amount sats" /></p>
<p>The next thing the wizard prompts you for is the percentage premium or discount you want on your swap. If you want to increase the market rate (premium), select a positive number; if you want to decrease it (discount), select a negative number. If you want neither, use the "No premium or discount" button.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/sell-prima.jpg" alt="Premium or discount" /></p>
<p>Next, you will need to specify the payment method. In this field, you can get creative and add emoticons or whatever you consider to make your request attractive.</p>
<p>The bot will proceed to publish your offer in the general or community channel you have set as default. It will remain visible for 23 hours if no one takes it before that time.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/channel-publication.jpg" alt="channel-publication" /></p>
<p>At any time you can cancel the offer, as long as no one has taken it, using the command <code>/cancel</code> followed by the order identifier. You can also copy the command plus the identifier in the chat with the bot.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/cancel-order-comand.jpg" alt="Cancel order command" /></p>
<p>The wizard will return a message confirming the cancellation and your offer will be removed from the offers channel.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/cancel-order.jpg" alt="Order cancelled" /></p>
<p>In case your sale is taken, the bot will ask your counterparty to deliver a Lightning Network invoice.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will ask you to pay the invoice with the corresponding amount in satoshis, plus a 0.6% commission. Remember that the network may charge you an additional amount for payment routing. This amount will depend on the nodes through which your transaction will pass and the network status. The bot has nothing to do with this amount.</p>
<p>At this point, the bot will contact both parties to discuss the details of the exchange.</p>
<p>Once the bot receives notice that the fiat amount was paid, it sends you an alert to check your account. If everything is in order, you can release the satoshis with the command <code>/release</code> followed by the transaction identifier (or copy and paste the text into the bot chat) and the transaction will be executed.</p>
<p>The exchange is finished. Now you can rate your counterparty.</p>
<p>You can exit the wizard at any time by executing the <code>/exit</code> command.</p>
<p>To execute the same sell order, without using the wizard, you must type your order with the details: <code>/sell &lt;amount in sats&gt; &lt;amount in fiat&gt; &lt;fiat code&gt; &lt;payment method&gt; [premium/discount]</code> (without the special characters).</p>
<p>Example: <code>/sell 100000 50 USD "bank xyz"</code> I sell one hundred thousand sats at fifty dollars I charge by bank xyz.</p>
<p>In case there is any unsupported variable, the bot will indicate it to you during the order creation process. Once completed, the order will be published in the exchange channel and will be visible for a period of 23 hours.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-create-a-buy-order"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-create-a-buy-order">How do I create a buy order?</a></h1>
<p>The procedure is exactly the same as for a sell order. However, when you press the "Menu" button, select the <code>/buy</code> command instead of <code>/sell</code>. This will activate the wizard that guides you through the buying process.</p>
<p>Once activated, the wizard will prompt you to specify the fiat currency you want to transact with:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-fiat.jpg" alt="Fiat currency" /></p>
<p>Next, enter the amount, in fiat currency, you wish to buy. Remember to input only numbers at this step so that the wizard can understand.</p>
<p>You can also enter a range of amounts to buy by separating the numbers with a hyphen (-).</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-monto.jpg" alt="Fiat amount" /></p>
<p>The wizard will ask for the amount, in satoshis, you want to receive. Here, you have the option to use the "Market Price" button. If you do, it will apply the rate from <a href="https://yadio.io/">Yadio.io</a>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-price.jpg" alt="Satoshi amount" /></p>
<p>Next, the wizard will request the percentage of premium or discount you desire in your exchange. If you want to increase the market rate (premium), select a positive number. If you want to decrease it (discount), choose a negative number. If you don’t want either, use the "No premium or discount" button.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-prima.jpg" alt="Premium or discount" /></p>
<p>You'll then need to specify the payment method. Here, you can get creative and add emojis or anything you feel will make your offer attractive.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-payment-method.jpg" alt="Payment method" /></p>
<p>The bot will proceed to publish your offer in the general channel or the one you've set as default for the community. It will remain visible for 23 hours if no one takes it before then.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-public.jpg" alt="Published offer" /></p>
<p>At any time, you can cancel the offer, provided no one has taken it, using the command <code>/cancel</code> followed by the order identifier. You can also copy the command plus the identifier in the chat with the bot.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-cancel-order.jpg" alt="Cancel order" /></p>
<p>The wizard will return a message confirming the cancellation, and your offer will be removed from the offers channel.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/buy-cancel.jpg" alt="Cancelled order" /></p>
<p>If your offer is taken, the wizard will ask you to provide a Lightning Network invoice with the corresponding amount in satoshis. Simultaneously, it will ask your counterpart to pay the invoice.</p>
<p>At this point, the bot will connect both parties to discuss the exchange details.</p>
<p>Once you've made the fiat payment, notify the bot with the command <code>/fiatsent</code>. The bot will inform your counterpart to check and confirm the receipt of the money and proceed to release the satoshis. Remember, your wallet needs to be online to receive them.</p>
<p>The exchange is completed. Now you can rate your counterpart.</p>
<p>You can exit the wizard at any time by executing the command <code>/exit</code>.</p>
<p>To execute the same buy order without using the wizard, you must write your order details: <code>/buy</code> <satoshi amount> <fiat amount> <fiat code> <payment method> [premium/discount] (without special characters).</p>
<p>Example: <code>/buy 100000 50 usd "xyz bank"</code></p>
<p>Buying one hundred thousand satoshis at fifty dollars paying via xyz bank.</p>
<p>Some examples of buy orders would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex. <code>/buy 0 50 ves "xyz bank"</code>: Buying fifty bolivars in satoshis - in this case, the bot will calculate at the market rate - paying via xyz bank</li>
<li>Ex. <code>/buy 0 10-100 pen "mobile payment"</code>: Buying from 10 to 100 new soles - in this case, the seller will choose the amount to sell you within that range - paying via mobile payment</li>
<li>Ex. <code>/buy 0 100 eur "mobile payment" -3</code>: Buying 100 euros with a 3% discount - in this case, the bot will calculate at the market rate by discounting or increasing the percentage you choose - paying via mobile payment</li>
</ul>
<p>If there's any incompatible variable, the bot will indicate it during the order creation process. Once completed, it will automatically publish on the exchange channel and remain visible for a period of 23 hours.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-search-for-and-accept-a-buying-or-selling-offer"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-search-for-and-accept-a-buying-or-selling-offer">How do I search for and accept a buying or selling offer?</a></h1>
<p>If you've never used <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a> before, you need to open it and type <code>/start</code> before taking any offers.</p>
<p>You'll find all active offers on the bot at <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a>, including yours. There, you can filter by fiat and communities.</p>
<p>In the Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/p2plightning">@p2plightning</a>, you'll find offers that haven't been published in any community.</p>
<p>To find offers published in communities, type the command <code>/findcomms &lt;fiat code&gt;</code> within the bot. For more information, read <a href="./where-i-can-find-offers-for-my-local-currency.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Review all the previous options until you find an order that suits your search, then click the <code>Buy satoshis</code> or <code>Sell satoshis</code> button, as appropriate. Next, go to the chat with <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a> to follow its instructions. If you find the offer from <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a>, it will redirect you to the channel where it's published so you can take it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another way to take an offer is to use the command <code>/takeorder &lt;order id&gt;</code>. For example, if you organize a Sat exchange with someone via <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a>, your counterpart can create the order and send you its ID. You can then directly take it from within the bot using the mentioned command, avoiding the need to go to the offers channel where it was published.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-cancel-a-posted-order"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-cancel-a-posted-order">How do I cancel a posted order?</a></h1>
<p>If the order hasn't been taken, type the command <code>/cancel</code> in your chat with the bot or select it from the "Menu." The bot will display your active orders. Choose the ID corresponding to the order you wish to cancel.</p>
<p>The ID or unique number of your order appears just below the acceptance and posting message of your order and is even indicated as an option to cancel it. You can also find it by typing the command <code>/listorders</code>.</p>
<p>If your order has already been taken or if you take an order and don’t wish to proceed, you'll need to initiate a cooperative cancellation.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/cancel-order.gif" alt="Cancel Order" /></p>
<p>By initiating a cooperative cancellation, your counterpart will be informed of your intent to cancel. If they agree, they'll also write <code>/cancel &lt;order id&gt;</code>, after which the Sats will be returned to the seller.</p>
<p>If your counterpart doesn’t agree to cancel, you can initiate a dispute by typing the command <code>/dispute</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="is-there-a-limit-minimum-or-maximum-on-the-amounts-i-can-trade"><a class="header" href="#is-there-a-limit-minimum-or-maximum-on-the-amounts-i-can-trade">Is there a limit (minimum or maximum) on the amounts I can trade?</a></h1>
<p>From the bot’s side, there are no limits to the volume of your transaction. However, it will depend on the network's capacity and the channel's liquidity that you can find a maximum limit at a given moment.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-complete-a-transaction"><a class="header" href="#how-long-does-it-take-to-complete-a-transaction">How long does it take to complete a transaction?</a></h1>
<p>It depends on several factors. Being a P2P exchange, the primary variable is the acceptance of your offer by a counterpart. Your listing will be available for up to 23 hours and will automatically be removed if nobody takes it.</p>
<p>Once an offer is accepted, there's a 15-minute window to pay the lightning invoice and for the bot to connect both parties. From this point, there's a maximum of 23 hours to finalize the transaction. After this time, the order expires, and the satoshis will be returned to the originating wallet. That's why users should use only instant fiat money payment methods for their transactions.</p>
<p>When both participants are online and agree on immediate payment methods, transactions are nearly instantaneous.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="should-i-pay-fees-and-commissions"><a class="header" href="#should-i-pay-fees-and-commissions">Should I pay fees and commissions?</a></h1>
<p>The bot charges a fixed fee of 0.6%. This fee includes the network fee, so there are no additional charges. This commission is paid only by the seller, not the buyer.</p>
<p>Some communities establish a small discount on the commissions for operations carried out within them. To find out the discount for each community, check <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a> in the COMMUNITIES section.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-exchange-rate-does-the-bot-use"><a class="header" href="#what-exchange-rate-does-the-bot-use">What exchange rate does the bot use?</a></h1>
<p>When creating an order, you can choose to specify only the fiat amount to <code>pay/receive</code>, without indicating the quantity of sats you want to <code>buy/sell</code>. In this case, you should select the <code>Market Price</code> button, and the bot will calculate the market rate offered by <a href="https://yadio.io/">yadio.io</a> at the moment your order is taken.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/market-price.gif" alt="Market Price" /></p>
<p>When you select the <code>Market Price</code> button, you can also set a premium or discount for your offer. This means an increase or decrease will be applied to the bitcoin price indicated by <a href="https://yadio.io/">yadio.io</a> at the time the offer is taken.</p>
<h4 id="practical-examples-with-their-meanings"><a class="header" href="#practical-examples-with-their-meanings">Practical examples with their meanings:</a></h4>

<p>As a P2P exchange on Telegram, technically, it's available for anyone using this app. However, currently, the bot interacts with a list of 94 fiat currencies with which you can create <code>buy/sell</code> orders using the <code>Market Price</code> button on the assistant.</p>

<p>For now, <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot"><strong>@lnp2pBot</strong></a> is fully available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Russian, and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>To change the assistant's language, use the <code>/setlang</code> command.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help translate <strong>lnp2pBot</strong> into your language, you can propose your collaboration. <a href="https://github.com/lnp2pBot/bot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">This is a good starting point.</a></p>

<p>By executing the command: <code>/findcomms</code> followed by the desired <a href="./in-which-countries-is-it-available.html">currency code</a> (you can use the ISO 4217 standard currency code), <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">lnp2pBot</a> will display the <a href="./communities.html">communities</a> created that operate with your currency.</p>
<p>Additionally, on <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a>, you can view all existing communities and some of their statistics, such as their <a href="./benevolent-dictator.html">creator</a>, their <a href="./what-is-a-solver.html">solvers</a>, the <a href="./incentives.html">percentage of discount</a>, the creation date, among others.</p>
<p>There might also be communities that operate with sats against another cryptocurrency. There are no limitations for the user.</p>
<p>In the following image, we can see the result of <code>/findcomms usd</code></p>

<p>When you start using <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pBot</a>, the orders you create are by default posted in <a href="https://t.me/p2plightning">https://t.me/p2plightning</a>, which is the general channel where you can find offers in various fiat currencies.</p>
<p>If you want to post offers in a channel specifically for your currency, you need to do so through a <a href="./communities.html">community</a> that incorporates it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can search for all communities operating with the desired currency at <a href="https://market.lnp2pbot.com">https://market.lnp2pbot.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also type within the bot:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>/findcomms &lt;fiat code&gt;</code></p>
<p>For example, <code>/findcomms usd</code> is used to search for all communities trading with USD. If you don't know your currency code, type <code>/listcurrencies</code> in the bot and find it.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/findcomms.jpg" alt="Find Community Capture" /></p>
<p>Upon selecting a community, the bot will display the number of successful orders, the trading volume operated in the last 24 hours, and the number of users posting their offers there. To set which community you want to publish your offers in, you should select the "Use as default" button.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/comm-detail.jpg" alt="Community details Capture" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Another way to do it is by typing:
<code>/setcomm &lt;@communityGroupName | telegram-group-id&gt;</code> (<code>/setcomm</code> along with the group name or its Telegram ID).</li>
</ul>
<p>To create an order within a community, use the <code>/buy</code> or <code>/sell</code> command depending on what you want. From there, the bot will give you step-by-step instructions, and your offer will be published in the selected community.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/sell.jpg" alt="Community Wizard Capture" /></p>
<h2 id="more-information"><a class="header" href="#more-information">More Information:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can only have one community configured by default at a time, and therefore, all your offers will be posted there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To leave a community and post offers again in the <a href="https://t.me/p2plightning">general channel</a>, you should type:
<code>/setcomm off</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to post an offer in multiple communities simultaneously, you need to create it in each one separately: first, post it in one, then configure another as default and post there as well, and so on for all the communities you want it in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way is to type your order as a command within the chat of a community where the bot is an administrator, as it will recognize it and post the offer in that community without you needing to set it as default.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can take offers from as many communities as you want without having to configure any of them as default.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="recommended-wallets"><a class="header" href="#recommended-wallets">Recommended Wallets</a></h1>
<p>The following wallets have shown better performance when used with <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pBot</a>:</p>

<h4 id="notes-on-other-wallets"><a class="header" href="#notes-on-other-wallets">Notes on other wallets</a></h4>
<p>With <code>Wallet of Satoshi</code>, or any other custodial service, it might occur that if you're selling Sats and the order is canceled, your wallet balance might take a while to update, and the Sats might not appear available for some hours, even if they're in the wallet's node. This delay happens because custodial wallets update their users' balances periodically, so you'll have to wait for a few hours.</p>
<p>It's common for payments from <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pBot</a> to <code>Muun wallet</code> to fail because the bot can only pay a maximum routing fee of up to 0.2%. Hence, it might not cover the invoice when Muun charges fees higher than that. In such cases, you'll need to generate a new invoice from another wallet (More info <a href="./i-cant-receive.html">here</a>).
It's also possible that if you're selling Sats from Muun wallet and the order is canceled, a fee will still be charged because Muun wallet isn't a native LN wallet; it's an on-chain wallet that operates through submarine swaps. For any transaction, you'll have to pay the mining fee, even if the bot's hold invoice was canceled.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-problems-and-solutions"><a class="header" href="#common-problems-and-solutions">Common Problems and Solutions</a></h1>
<h3 id="im-trying-to-take-an-order-but-nothing-happens"><a class="header" href="#im-trying-to-take-an-order-but-nothing-happens">I'm trying to take an order, but nothing happens</a></h3>
<p>When you press the <code>Buy Satoshis</code> or <code>Sell Satoshis</code> button on an offer, <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a> will respond privately with what you need to do to complete the process.
For the bot to respond to your request, it's necessary to <a href="./how-do-i-initialize-the-bot.html">initialize it</a> because no bot can open a chat with you initially if you haven't used it before. Open <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a> and type the command <code>/start</code> or tap the <code>Start</code> button, then try taking the order again, return to the bot, and follow its instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you were already using the bot and the last time you did so was before March 2023, you need to reinitialize it with the command <code>/start</code> because it was reset, and its previous database wasn't preserved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-tried-to-pay-an-invoice-with-an-insufficiently-funded-wallet-and-now-lnp2pbot-tells-me-the-invoice-was-used"><a class="header" href="#i-tried-to-pay-an-invoice-with-an-insufficiently-funded-wallet-and-now-lnp2pbot-tells-me-the-invoice-was-used">I tried to pay an invoice with an insufficiently funded wallet, and now <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a> tells me the invoice was used</a></h3>
<p>Wait for 15 minutes for the transaction time to expire, and then initiate it again to generate a new invoice.</p>
<h3 id="my-counterpart-had-an-issue-sending-me-the-fiat-payment-and-then-disappeared-my-sats-got-stuck"><a class="header" href="#my-counterpart-had-an-issue-sending-me-the-fiat-payment-and-then-disappeared-my-sats-got-stuck">My counterpart had an issue sending me the fiat payment and then disappeared; my sats got stuck</a></h3>
<p>The transaction will automatically cancel after 23 hours, and your satoshis will appear in your wallet as a failed payment. If you want to expedite the process, you can open a dispute with the command <code>/dispute &lt;order id&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="a-user-mistakenly-took-my-purchase-and-ive-already-made-the-payment-in-satoshis"><a class="header" href="#a-user-mistakenly-took-my-purchase-and-ive-already-made-the-payment-in-satoshis">A user mistakenly took my purchase, and I've already made the payment in satoshis</a></h3>
<p>A cooperative cancellation can be initiated. Both parties need to execute the command <code>/cancel &lt;order id&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="i-canceled-an-order-but-the-sats-havent-returned-to-my-wallet-how-long-should-i-wait"><a class="header" href="#i-canceled-an-order-but-the-sats-havent-returned-to-my-wallet-how-long-should-i-wait">I canceled an order, but the sats haven't returned to my wallet. How long should I wait?</a></h3>
<p>When an order is canceled, the seller's satoshis immediately return to the node/wallet that made the payment. If you use a self-custody wallet or your own node, you won't have any issues. However, if you use a wallet that custodies your funds, you'll need to wait for them to reflect your balance in their internal system. This can take from a few minutes to a couple of hours depending on the wallet, but all wallets return 100% of your funds. Patience is key.</p>
<h3 id="im-buying-and-the-bot-doesnt-ask-me-for-an-invoice-instead-it-directly-connects-me-with-the-seller"><a class="header" href="#im-buying-and-the-bot-doesnt-ask-me-for-an-invoice-instead-it-directly-connects-me-with-the-seller">I'm buying, and the bot doesn't ask me for an invoice; instead, it directly connects me with the seller</a></h3>
<p>This happens when you have a lightning address activated. In that case, the purchased satoshis will be sent directly there without asking for a new invoice for each purchase. To check your lightning address, type the command <code>/settings</code> within the <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">bot</a>. If you want to deactivate it, type the command <code>/setaddress off</code> within the <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">bot</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-know-if-the-seller-actually-released-the-sats"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-know-if-the-seller-actually-released-the-sats">How do I know if the seller actually released the sats?</a></h1>
<p>If @lnp2pBot tells you that the vendor released, it really is, but if you want to verify it you can do it as follows:</p>
<p>Write to the bot <code>/listorders</code> and if the bot is still in the process of paying your invoice the status you will see will be <code>PAID_HOLD_INVOICE</code>, if the bot has already paid the invoice the order will not appear on the list.</p>
<p>When an order has status <code>PAID_HOLD_INVOICE</code>, the seller no longer has any responsibility because he/she has released the sats, if you have problems receiving go to the section <a href="./i-cant-receive.html">The seller released but I don't get the sats in my wallet</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-seller-released-but-i-havent-received-the-sats-in-my-wallet"><a class="header" href="#the-seller-released-but-i-havent-received-the-sats-in-my-wallet">The seller released, but I haven't received the Sats in my wallet</a></h1>
<h2 id="possible-causes"><a class="header" href="#possible-causes">Possible Causes</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, the bot cannot find successful routes to make the payment for various reasons. It could be due to a poor connection between the origin and destination, or it can be more complicated, such as nodes connected to the destination charging very high fees.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pBot</a> node is willing to pay up to 0.2% of the total transaction amount in routing fees. If this fee is higher, the bot simply won't make the payment. Some non-native Lightning wallets might charge more than 0.2% when the mempool is congested, and the bot won't be able to pay them (more information on wallets <a href="./recommended-wallets.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>Another scenario could be that you lack 'inbound capacity.' For instance, if you're using the Blixt wallet and have just opened a channel, all the funds in that wallet would be outbound, and you wouldn't have the capacity to receive. In this case, all payments to that wallet will fail. Modern wallets like Phoenix wallet address this by indicating the lack of inbound capacity and proposing channel modifications (<a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/">splice in</a>) to ensure the new received payment is on the user's side (more inbound capacity). This wallet charges a fee for this service.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>
<p>When a payment fails, the bot will attempt to make the payment two more times with 5-minute intervals. If it continues to fail, the bot will ask you to provide a new invoice to continue trying. It's advisable to generate this invoice from another <a href="./recommended-wallets.html">wallet</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't input the invoice within 20 minutes after the bot requests it, that assistant will be canceled, and it won't request it again later. In that case, you should input it using the command:
<code>/setinvoice &lt;order id&gt; &lt;lightning invoice&gt;</code>
(Do not include the symbols &lt;&gt;, separate each part with a space, and do not reuse invoices).</p>
<p>If you've tried several times and still haven't received the Sats, stay calm. It's no longer possible to cancel the transaction or return the Sats to the seller. Instead, they are in the bot's node, and you can continue trying with new invoices as many times as necessary until you receive them.</p>

<p>Since the inception of this project, we aimed to operate <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@LNP2Pbot</a> without making much noise. It was crucial to test the bot within a small community before showcasing the final product to the world. That's why we started working with the Spanish-speaking Lightning community, which welcomed the project very positively. The feedback received has allowed the bot to grow and improve every day.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="communities"><a class="header" href="#communities">Communities</a></h1>
<p>Communities were design so that users may interact in small groups, adapted to their tastes and needs.</p>
<p>Communities can be created around a project, a currency, or a country, for example.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a community and interact with the bot from it. Witch leaves creators/administrators with great power in their hands, “a great power comes with a great responsibility” This means that once users start working in their own communities, they will also have to manage any disputes that may occur.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trust"><a class="header" href="#trust">Trust</a></h1>
<p>The model we have chosen to resolve disputes is that of trust. This seems paradoxical for those who work with Bitcoin and advocate of "trustless" systems. The truth is that the goal is to develop systems in which we do not have to trust anyone. But after thinking a lot about dispute resolution systems, we had to accept that you always have to trust someone to some extent.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="benevolent-dictator"><a class="header" href="#benevolent-dictator">Benevolent Dictator</a></h1>
<p>Having accepted that trusting someone is necessary to resolve a dispute, how can we create fewer incentives for disputes to arise? Regarding this matter, the community has proposed several ideas. The one we've developed is to utilize the concept of a "benevolent dictator." This individual acts as a "dictator" whom people accept and trust to make decisions for the community's welfare. Let's say it's a trusted mediator within the community.</p>
<p>The benevolent dictator is the creator of the community, responsible for appointing dispute solvers or 'solvers'. These individuals are publicly recognized within the community (by their Telegram username). The community is responsible for reporting if these users are performing their duties correctly or not. In a community where the "benevolent dictator" selects solvers correctly, everything will function well. In a community where the dictator makes mistakes, community members might move to another community or create a new one. This way, we delegate this responsibility to the communities.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-do-i-create-a-community"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-create-a-community">How do I create a community?</a></h1>
<p>To create a community, simply type the <code>/community</code> command. After this, the bot will ask you to indicate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Name: A name to identify your community.</li>
<li>Currencies: Fiat currencies that can operate in the community. These must be entered separately from a blank space. For example, for an Uruguayan community, "UYU USD" can be added.</li>
<li>Community Group: This is the main group where members of the community meet. Both <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a> and the person creating the community must be administrators in this group. Users will be able to create orders by sending bot commands in this group.</li>
<li>Order book channel or channels: Orders will be published where we indicate to the bot. If we enter a single channel, the purchases and sales will be published in that channel, but if you indicate two channels, the purchases will be published in the first and the sales in the second. Channels are entered separately with a blank space and both the bot and the community creator must be channel admins.</li>
<li>Solvers: We must indicate the “usernames” of the users who will be in charge of resolving the disputes, separated by a blank space.</li>
<li>Channel for disputes: In this channel, the bot will publish when a user initiates a dispute. Both the bot and the community creator must be channel administrators.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lets-get-started-communities-first-steps"><a class="header" href="#lets-get-started-communities-first-steps">Let's Get Started. Communities, First Steps</a></h1>
<p>To create a community, you must type or select the command <code>/community</code> from the menu. From there, the bot will guide you through the process.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/community-menu.jpg" alt="Community Menu capture" /></p>
<p><a href="how-do-i-create-a-community.html">In this post, there are the details</a>, for a better understanding. It's important to note that both you and the bot must be administrators in both the community group and the channels linked to it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modifying-a-community"><a class="header" href="#modifying-a-community">Modifying a community</a></h1>
<p>To modify any field, we simply execute the <code>/mycomms</code> command and the bot will show you a menu that will help you select the community you want to modify and the specific field.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-orders"><a class="header" href="#creating-orders">Creating orders</a></h1>
<p>The operation of the bot remains exactly the same, by default it creates the orders in a global channel. But since we have created a new community we want our order to be published in the channel that we have associated with the community. There are two ways to create an order in the new community.</p>
<p>We enter the community group (in the case of our example it would be @p2pZimbabwe) and within the group, we execute the usual command: <code>/sell</code> or <code>/buy</code>.
If we want something more private, we tell the bot our default community by running the <code>/setcomm</code> @p2pZimbabwe command. From then on, all orders you create privately will go to the corresponding channel linked to @p2pZimbabwe. You can change your default community at any time with <code>/setcomm</code> @Coolercommunity (example). You can also go back to the previous state, where you didn't have a community by default, by running <code>/setcomm</code> off.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="incentives"><a class="header" href="#incentives">Incentives</a></h1>
<p>Since its inception, <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pbot">@lnp2pbot</a> has charged a fee to the seller for a successfully completed order, which is currently set at 0.6%. When the order is created within a community, the bot splits this fee: a portion goes to the bot, and the rest becomes the community's profit.</p>
<p>The proportions are: 67% of the commission goes to the bot, and the remaining 33% goes to the community.</p>
<p>For example, in a transaction of 100,000 satoshis, the seller pays a commission of 600 satoshis. From that amount, 402 satoshis go to the bot, and the remaining 198 satoshis go to the community.</p>
<p>However, to incentivize competition, the community has the authority to decrease its 'profit'. Instead of charging the entire 33%, it can reduce a percentage in its commissions.</p>
<p>In the previous example, instead of charging the full 198 satoshis (100%), it could choose to charge 99 satoshis (50%). The remaining satoshis act as a discount for the seller, who would then pay 501 satoshis instead of the initial 600 satoshis.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="managing-a-community"><a class="header" href="#managing-a-community">Managing a Community</a></h1>
<p>Once the community has been created, it is necessary to start the administration work.</p>
<p>The first thing is to designate at least one person to resolve disputes that arise. <a href="what-is-a-solver.html">That person is the solvers</a>.</p>
<p>Then, establish the channels in which purchases and sales will be made. At first, a single channel will suffice for both, but as the community grows it may be necessary to establish a channel for each.</p>
<p>Another of the tasks of the administrator is to decide the rate that the community will charge. <a href="incentives.html">Here you have the explanation of how the rates work</a>.</p>
<p>The administrator can modify any field of the community whenever he wants.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: To execute the community administration commands, the community with which you want to work must be selected by default.
To do this, use the 'Use by default' button that is displayed after executing <code>/findcomms</code>, you can also do it with the command <code>/setcomm</code> @tobemanagedgroup.
A telegram group gets its @group by going public.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-solver"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-solver">What is a solver</a></h1>
<p>Solvers are users appointed by the community administrator and are responsible for resolving disputes and maintaining order.</p>
<p>A community must have at least one solver. There is no requirement to be a solver. The administrator can add or remove them at any time.</p>
<p>The administrator can be a solver in his community.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="resolving-disputes"><a class="header" href="#resolving-disputes">Resolving disputes</a></h1>
<p>When a user initiates a dispute, a message is sent by the bot to the dispute channel. Only <strong>solvers</strong> can take it by tapping the <strong>Take dispute</strong> button. Before taking a dispute, the solver must be sure that he/she have the community setted up, to set up the community, the solver must run the command <code>/setcomm @community-group</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/dispute.jpg" alt="Dispute Capture" /></p>
<p>Once the solver takes the dispute, the bot will send them all the necessary information to resolve it. The solver will also have to communicate with each party, understand what happened, and <strong>complete</strong> the order or <strong>cancel it</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/dispute-detail.jpg" alt="Dispute details capture" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="completing-an-order"><a class="header" href="#completing-an-order">Completing an Order</a></h1>
<p>Many disputes arise because one of the parties took time to respond to a message, there was a misunderstanding, or there was a delay in a payment. These are straightforward cases that only require patience and assistance in communication.</p>
<p>Other cases involve malicious intent, such as when a seller wants to keep the fiat money and get the sats returned. In these cases, the solver can execute the <code>/settleorder</code> command, which recognizes the received payment and automatically sends the sats to the buyer.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/settleorder.png" alt="Completing an Order" /></p>
<h2 id="completing-an-order-when-fiat-takes-too-long-to-arrive"><a class="header" href="#completing-an-order-when-fiat-takes-too-long-to-arrive">Completing an Order When Fiat Takes Too Long to Arrive</a></h2>
<p>With <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a>, payment methods ensuring instant fiat transfer should be used. However, there might be instances where the fiat takes longer than usual to reach the sat seller, for example, due to issues in payment processing by the bank.
In such situations, the buyer risks the possibility that the seller does not receive the fiat <a href="./how-long-does-it-take-to-finalize-a-transaction.html">before the hold invoice expires</a>, hence not releasing the sats. However, once it expires, the seller will have the sats again, followed by the fiat. The buyer would then be at the mercy of the seller's goodwill, who might or might not send the satoshis, without any bot intervention. To prevent this, users can turn to the solvers in their community to act as mediators.</p>
<p>A solver can make the bot charge the hold invoice from the seller using the <code>/freezeorder &lt;order_id&gt;</code> command. This way, they can wait long enough for the fiat to arrive, and when it does, the solver will release the sats using the <code>/paytobuyer &lt;order_id&gt;</code> command. The buyer's invoice may have expired during the process, so they'll need to update it by typing <code>/setinvoice &lt;order id&gt; &lt;lightning invoice&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This solution implies custody of the sats by the bot and should only be used when no other options exist.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="canceling-an-order"><a class="header" href="#canceling-an-order">Canceling an order</a></h1>
<p>The other alternative that the solver has is to cancel the order if the case warrants it. To do this, use the <code>/cancelorder</code> command. This returns the sats to the seller.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/images/cancelorder.png" alt="Cancel order capture" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="removing-disputes"><a class="header" href="#removing-disputes">Removing disputes</a></h1>
<p>Every time a user initiates a dispute, both he and his counterpart are involved in it. Until it is resolved, both remain related, when resolved, the solver has the power to eliminate this dispute from one of the users or both, if he needs it, with the command
<code>/deldispute username order-id</code>.</p>

<p>If a solver deems it necessary, they can ban a user from the community using the command <code>/ban</code> followed by their username.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="secure-exchanges-on-lnp2pbot"><a class="header" href="#secure-exchanges-on-lnp2pbot">Secure Exchanges on @lnp2pbot</a></h1>
<p>@lnp2pbot is a secure tool for peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange without KYC. When two individuals connect to engage in a purchase, the seller's Satoshis (Sats) remain locked in their own wallet via a hold invoice and cannot be utilized while in this state. Once the buyer sends fiat money and the seller confirms to the bot that they've received it, the Sats are then transferred to the bot's node, which promptly pays the buyer.</p>
<p>The bot incorporates a <a href="https://lnp2pbot.com/learn/how-does-the-user-reputation-system-work.html">user reputation system</a> that considers the number of successful transactions and received ratings. Moreover, it displays the duration for which a person has been using the platform. These details can assist you in making decisions regarding accepting or declining offers according to your own interests.</p>
<p>Additionally, every community on the bot has at least one Solver responsible for mediating disputes that may arise. They request necessary evidence from the involved parties and determine the rightful recipient of the Sats. If a scammer is detected, they are permanently banned from using the bot.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scam-attempts"><a class="header" href="#scam-attempts">Scam Attempts</a></h1>
<p>Scam attempts using the bot are not frequent, but like any decentralized, KYC-free peer-to-peer exchange, it's not immune to them. To avoid falling victim to scams, caution must be exercised, being attentive to suspicious behavior, and in case of doubt, cancel the operation or open a dispute.</p>
<h2 id="possible-scams"><a class="header" href="#possible-scams">Possible Scams:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A scammer trying to buy Sats might use the <code>/fiatsent</code> command to claim they've sent fiat money when, in reality, they haven't, hoping the seller will trust their word and release the Sats without verifying the receipt of fiat. It's crucial for the seller to ensure they've received fiat before using the <code>/release</code> command, even if the buyer sends an image as proof of payment, as it could be manipulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some fiat payment methods are reversible, like PayPal, which scammers can exploit to purchase Sats and then reverse the fiat transfer. We recommend using only irreversible payment methods to avoid this type of scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To increase the decentralized use of the bot, there's an option for any user to create a <a href="https://lnp2pbot.com/learn/communities.html">community</a>. Despite excellent outcomes, there's a possibility that a scammer creates a community where they act as a Solver and make fraudulent dispute decisions, either with other scammers or as part of operations. However, this kind of scam would have a short duration, as the scammer would be quickly exposed, impacting the community's reputation, leading to user loss, and banning of scammers. Before joining a community, it's advisable to research the creator and the Solvers, check if they have common groups, their overall reputation, as well as consider the group's trading volume, age, number of users, and verify their authenticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fraudulent seller might take advantage of the hold invoices in @lnp2pbot, which have an expiry time of around 23 hours. They might not use the <code>/release</code> command to release the Sats despite receiving fiat from the buyer, allowing the invoice time to expire with excuses or even disconnecting intentionally. This aims to reclaim the Sats and keep the fiat without any interference from the bot or a Solver. To prevent this, when purchasing Sats, use an instant payment method. If the seller doesn't release the Sats and remains unresponsive after a couple of hours, open a dispute. Never wait until close to the time limit to initiate a dispute, as the solver might not resolve it before it expires, resulting in the Sats being returned to the seller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some scammers establish multiple operations within the bot to build relationships with users and then contact them privately to persuade them to conduct transactions outside the bot. This is risky as there's no guarantee they'll fulfill their part. We recommend not engaging in transactions outside the bot, even if the offers seem enticing. You can suggest conducting them using <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a> for mutual security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tips-to-avoid-scams"><a class="header" href="#tips-to-avoid-scams">Tips to Avoid Scams</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you're using <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a> for the first time, educate yourself about how it works, review available documentation, and start with small amounts until you fully understand the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before accepting an offer, check the user's reputation, the number of trades, the bot usage time, as well as the trade volume if visible. Be wary of offers that seem too good, especially if they come from users with a short history using the bot but with numerous operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid engaging in trades outside the bot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not agree to change the fiat payment method if it wasn't part of the initial offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable with a trade, you can request a cooperative cancellation as long as the fiat hasn't been sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise caution with new and low-volume communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not agree to trade in another community if it wasn't your choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're planning to open a dispute, do it on time, well before 23 hours have passed since the offer was accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you notice suspicious behavior, report it to the corresponding community administrators. They can take appropriate measures to protect users and inform administrators of other communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share only essential personal information necessary for the exchange. Avoid providing more information than necessary, such as your personal phone number, address, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone you've traded with before sends you fiat money without prior notice (even claiming it was a mistake) and demands you send them the corresponding Sats, it could be a bridge scam. In such cases, it's advisable to return the fiat to the same account it was sent from and avoid continuing with the forced exchange they're attempting to push you into.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="account-triangulation-scams-or-bridge-scams"><a class="header" href="#account-triangulation-scams-or-bridge-scams">Account Triangulation Scams or Bridge Scams</a></h1>
<p>This type of scam is challenging to prevent and detect because, from the seller's perspective, everything seems to proceed normally. It's important to note that they can occur in any type of peer-to-peer exchange, not just on <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a>. These scams involve a scammer acting as an intermediary between the victim and the seller, where the seller receives the fiat sent by the victim but hands over the Sats to the scammer.</p>
<p>The scammer offers the sale of products or services (whether it's a second-hand item or even iPhone unlocking) on any social network or specialized platform for buying and selling. When the victim contacts the scammer, they request an upfront payment. Simultaneously, the scammer posts an offer to buy Sats on <a href="https://t.me/lnp2pBot">@lnp2pbot</a> (or another peer-to-peer exchange) for an amount equivalent to the fiat they aim to scam (they might put up an offer with a high premium to make it more attractive). When the scammer finds a Sats seller and requests their details to receive the fiat, they provide these details to the victim for the aforementioned upfront payment. Once the victim's fiat reaches the Sats seller and the seller presses the <code>/release</code> command, the bitcoins are released to the scammer, who disappears and never fulfills the service or sale promised to the victim.</p>
<p>It's crucial to emphasize that the Sats seller is also a victim in this triangulation, as they interact only with the scammer, unaware of a third party in the exchange. They assume that the fiat they receive was directly sent by the buyer of their Sats. However, they might face accusations of fraud when their bank details are provided to authorities in a report regarding payment for a service or product that wasn't received. It's advisable not to delete the bot's history or chats with your Sats buyers or to create a backup, as these records might be necessary as evidence to prove that no one was scammed.</p>
<p>Some scammers might even ask for additional personal information from sellers to later share it with the direct victims of the triangulation, creating a sense of trust. Therefore, it's recommended not to provide personal information like phone numbers, full names, or addresses unless it's essential for the payment method used.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bridge-scam-prevention"><a class="header" href="#bridge-scam-prevention">Bridge Scam Prevention</a></h1>
<p>There isn't a foolproof method to completely prevent a seller from engaging in a bridge scam. However, besides following the previously mentioned tips to prevent scams, there are other measures you, as a seller, could take to reduce the risk, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to make a large sale of Sats, it's preferable to split it into several smaller sales, unless the buyer has a good history of transactions with you and consistently uses the same bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be cautious if a buying offer seems too good to be true; it might be a scam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fiat payment methods that allow adding comments to the transfer, you could ask the buyer to write a specific phrase you mention at that moment, like "I'm buying an orange." This way, if they were a scammer, they'd have to ask the victim to write that comment to send the fiat, which could raise suspicion as it's highly unlikely that they are buying an orange.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can modify that phrase to a numerical code or another message you find appropriate to prevent a scam. Another method, though not highly recommended due to privacy concerns, is to request the phrase to be: "This payment is for a purchase of X Sats on @lnp2pbot for order ID: Y."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some fiat payment methods don't allow adding comments but reveal both parties' phone numbers. In such cases, you could ask the buyer, before releasing the Sats, for an SMS from the number that sent the fiat, containing any of the aforementioned messages or similar messages. Another approach could be a call initiated by them or you, directly confirming no third-party involvement in the fiat transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another option, not highly recommended if you wish to respect the buyer's privacy, is to request a video call on Telegram where they show they possess the card from which they sent the money. However, they don't need to show their face for this purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you're uncomfortable with a transaction, you can engage in a cooperative cancellation with <code>/cancel</code> and return the fiat to the same account from which it was sent. If the other party is unwilling to cooperate, you should open a dispute with <code>/dispute</code> and wait for a solver to resolve the case.</p>
<p>The preventive measures mentioned here may not apply to all fiat money payment methods. If you're aware of other methods, please share them and contribute to preventing scams.</p>
