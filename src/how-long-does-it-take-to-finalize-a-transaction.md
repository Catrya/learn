# How long does it take to complete a transaction?

It depends on several factors. Being a P2P exchange, the primary variable is the acceptance of your offer by a counterpart. Your listing will be available for up to 23 hours and will automatically be removed if nobody takes it.

Once an offer is accepted, there's a 15-minute window to pay the lightning invoice and for the bot to connect both parties. From this point, there's a maximum of 23 hours to finalize the transaction. After this time, the order expires, and the satoshis will be returned to the originating wallet. That's why users should use only instant fiat money payment methods for their transactions.

When both participants are online and agree on immediate payment methods, transactions are nearly instantaneous.
