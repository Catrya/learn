# How Can I Find Communities that Use My Currency?

By executing the command: `/findcomms` followed by the desired [currency code](./in-which-countries-is-it-available.md) (you can use the ISO 4217 standard currency code), [lnp2pBot](https://t.me/lnp2pBot) will display the [communities](./communities.md) created that operate with your currency.

Additionally, on [https://market.lnp2pbot.com](https://market.lnp2pbot.com), you can view all existing communities and some of their statistics, such as their [creator](./benevolent-dictator.md), their [solvers](./what-is-a-solver.md), the [percentage of discount](./incentives.md), the creation date, among others.

There might also be communities that operate with sats against another cryptocurrency. There are no limitations for the user.
