# Communities

Communities were design so that users may interact in small groups, adapted to their tastes and needs.

Communities can be created around a project, a currency, or a country, for example.

Anyone can create a community and interact with the bot from it. Witch leaves creators/administrators with great power in their hands, “a great power comes with a great responsibility” This means that once users start working in their own communities, they will also have to manage any disputes that may occur.
