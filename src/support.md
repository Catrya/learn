# Support

[@lnp2pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot) isn't a company, so it doesn't have a technical support department. However, there's a community you can turn to if you need assistance.

The main Telegram groups where you can ask for help are:
- Spanish Group: [https://t.me/lnp2pbotHelp](https://t.me/lnp2pbotHelp)
- English Group: [https://t.me/LNp2pBotHelpEn](https://t.me/LNp2pBotHelpEn)

Additionally, you can ask questions and request help in the [community](./community-find.md) of the bot you're using and stay in direct contact with the administrator and the solver(s) of that community.
