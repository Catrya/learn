Since the inception of this project, we aimed to operate [@LNP2Pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pBot) without making much noise. It was crucial to test the bot within a small community before showcasing the final product to the world. That's why we started working with the Spanish-speaking Lightning community, which welcomed the project very positively. The feedback received has allowed the bot to grow and improve every day.
