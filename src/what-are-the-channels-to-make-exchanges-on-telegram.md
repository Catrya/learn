# What are the channels for making exchanges on Telegram?

To create your `Buy / Sell` orders for Bitcoin, use the chat with [@lnp2pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot).

The offers created with [@lnp2pBot](https://t.me/lnp2pBot) are published in Telegram channels from where they can be taken by clicking the `Buy Satoshis` or `Sell Satoshis` button that appears below each one.

There is a general channel [@p2plightning](https://t.me/p2plightning) where offers that do not belong to any [community](./communities.md) are listed, hence there are various fiat currencies available. Additionally, there are [channels associated with communities](./community-find.md) where only offers with the fiat currencies permitted in those communities are published.
