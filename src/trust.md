The model we have chosen to resolve disputes is that of trust. This seems paradoxical for those who work with Bitcoin and advocate of "trustless" systems. The truth is that the goal is to develop systems in which we do not have to trust anyone. But after thinking a lot about dispute resolution systems, we had to accept that you always have to trust someone to some extent.
