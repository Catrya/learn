# Should I pay fees and commissions?

The bot charges a fixed fee of 0.6%. This fee includes the network fee, so there are no additional charges. This commission is paid only by the seller, not the buyer.

Some communities establish a small discount on the commissions for operations carried out within them. To find out the discount for each community, check [https://market.lnp2pbot.com](https://market.lnp2pbot.com) in the COMMUNITIES section.
