# How do I search for and accept a buying or selling offer?

If you've never used [@lnp2pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot) before, you need to open it and type `/start` before taking any offers.

You'll find all active offers on the bot at [https://market.lnp2pbot.com](https://market.lnp2pbot.com), including yours. There, you can filter by fiat and communities.

In the Telegram channel [@p2plightning](https://t.me/p2plightning), you'll find offers that haven't been published in any community.

To find offers published in communities, type the command `/findcomms <fiat code>` within the bot. For more information, read [here](./where-i-can-find-offers-for-my-local-currency.md).

Review all the previous options until you find an order that suits your search, then click the `Buy satoshis` or `Sell satoshis` button, as appropriate. Next, go to the chat with [@lnp2pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot) to follow its instructions. If you find the offer from [https://market.lnp2pbot.com](https://market.lnp2pbot.com), it will redirect you to the channel where it's published so you can take it.

- Another way to take an offer is to use the command `/takeorder <order id>`. For example, if you organize a Sat exchange with someone via [@lnp2pbot](https://t.me/lnp2pbot), your counterpart can create the order and send you its ID. You can then directly take it from within the bot using the mentioned command, avoiding the need to go to the offers channel where it was published.
