# Where can I find offers in my local currency?

You can ask the bot by running the command `/findcomms` along with the [code for your currency](./in-which-countries-is-it-available.md).

For instance, to see the [communities](./communities.md) in Venezuelan bolivars, you should type:

`/findcomms ves`

You can also search for offers filtered by currencies and communities on [https://market.lnp2pbot.com](https://market.lnp2pbot.com) and in the general channel [@p2plightning](https://t.me/p2plightning).
