# What type of information do you collect from each user?

For the purposes of the user reputation system, lnp2pBot collects some statistics on your trades. Specifically, the number of completed transactions, the total volume traded, the counterparty rating and the record of disputes if any. Of this information, only the number of transactions and the counterparty rating are public by default. Meanwhile, showing the total volume traded and your username is optional (you choose to show it or not, by default it is not shown).

In case you want to show your username and/or volume traded to accompany your reputation in the offers you publish, you must do it manually through the following commands:

`/showusername` yes

`/showvolume` yes

Each command is sent as a direct message to the bot.
